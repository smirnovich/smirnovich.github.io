Zynq7000 is a powerful platform created by AMD (prev. Xilinx) in 2011 and it continues to extend its popularity. The amount of available development board across the internet and the architecture of Zynq7000 chip makes it universal to both learn digital design with HDL and go from bottom to Linux. In the next series of posts I would like to cover different aspects of what is possible to do with Vivado + Vitis combination that might be hidden at first glance.

## Getting started

To understand the rest of the series let's uncover the architectural features which makes Zynq7000 more powerfull comparing to other implementations of Cortex-A9
